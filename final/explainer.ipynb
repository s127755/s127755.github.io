    "My primary dataset is from http://data.kk.dk/dataset/faste-trafiktaellinger and is about traffic (car) counts on different roads in Copenhagen. I find this dataset interesting because i live in Copenhagen and generally see a lot of traffic. I Want to know when there is more traffic than other times and i want to know more about how much traffic there actually is in Copenhagen.\n",
    "I've combined the linked dataset with other datasets from the same site.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset started out being a bit messy and i had to manually copy the relevant data for each year from an excel file to another, and saving it as a .csv file in order to work with it through python. \n",
    "The next step was to rename some of the keys in the dataset, making them easier to use. I've changed the time-stamp keys from 'kl.00-01' to simply just '0' (all the way to 'kl.23-00' to just '23').\n",
    "Going through the dataset i've discovered that the coordinates were in a different coordinate system than what I have used before. They were in UTM32 coordinates while i wanted them in the LatLng coordinate system. I found another dataset which is linked to the main one with all counting station on, and also their LatLng coordinates. So i linked the two datasets getting coordinates for each of the counting stations.\n",
    "Afterwards I've made different smaller datasets witch is easier for the website to load comparet to iterating over the whole dataset time after time. These datasets contains averages of different data, which is explained on the site where i show my plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall there are a total of 183.397 number of rows in my main dataset and it has a total size of 28MB."
